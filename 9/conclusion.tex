\section{Future work}
With more time available, the next few things to do would be to improve the DLP integration. For instance, custom info types might be a future goal to integrate into Hawk DLP. Another exciting possibility is adding support for Service Meshes like Istio / OSM in the Cluster detection module.
Besides those functional changes, a goal is to build up a community of users and contributors that further improve this project.

\section{Conclusion}
The Hawk Framework aims to reduce barriers when using existing Transparency Enhancing Technologies. By introducing certain technical concepts like abstractions and generalized APIs, these barriers could be reduced compared to those other technologies in standalone mode.
