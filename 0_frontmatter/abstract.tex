In the realm of digitalization, cloud-native architectures are becoming more and more prominent. Although this development has many advantages, one disadvantage is the tracking of personal data in the scope of regulatory frameworks, such as the GDPR.
This thesis analyzes the challenges companies are facing when dealing with this topic and offers a possible solution for it.


More specifically, this thesis extends to the Hawk Project and adds new concepts. Also, a deep dive into Data Loss Prevention technologies will be presented. AWS Macie and Google Cloud DLP will be compared and explained in depth.
